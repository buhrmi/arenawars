## History

Gladiators 2 started in 2004 as a free-to-play text-based browser game. Even though it was very basic, the simple concept quickly ammassed thousands of players, which was a tiny bit impressive for that time.

You can still find some fragments in the Wayback Machine today: [Old landing page with story](https://web.archive.org/web/20041202235635/http://www.g2.onlineplayers.de/), [Old landing page with news](https://web.archive.org/web/20050206205824/http://g2.onlineplayers.de/)

In 2006 I gave the project away for free to the community leader, after announcing a successor: [Gladiators 3](https://web.archive.org/web/20050215164909/http://gladiators.schaunwama.de/forum/showthread.php?p=1581). This would later become [Gondal](https://web.archive.org/web/20060717024220/http://gondal.webtales.4players.de/). It was ultimately sold off, and the new owners reused the name and domain for a [new browsergame](https://gondal.de), which is in operation even today.

The Gladiators 2 community leader went on to rename the project Arenakampf and also gave it a new design: [Redesign and rename into arenakampf.de](https://web.archive.org/web/20150927070655/http://arenakampf.de/). The game managed to stay active until 2018, when it finally shut down.

Arena Wars is an attempt to capture all the good ideas and memories of the game and its past, make them come alive again with a modern codebase, and to maybe even reconnect with old players. If you are an old player and have been waiting for a "new gladi", feel free to hop in to the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/S4wb8V3GrP) and say hi.
