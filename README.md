## History

Gladiators 2 started in 2004 as a free-to-play text-based browser game. Even though it was very basic, the simple concept quickly ammassed thousands of players, which was a tiny bit impressive for that time.

You can still find some fragments in the Wayback Machine today: [Old landing page with story](https://web.archive.org/web/20041202235635/http://www.g2.onlineplayers.de/), [Old landing page with news](https://web.archive.org/web/20050206205824/http://g2.onlineplayers.de/)

In 2006 I donated the game and its source code to the community, after announcing a successor: [Gladiators 3](https://web.archive.org/web/20050215164909/http://gladiators.schaunwama.de/forum/showthread.php?p=1581). This would later become [Gondal](https://web.archive.org/web/20060717024220/http://gondal.webtales.4players.de/). It was ultimately sold off, and the new owners reused the name and domain for a [new browsergame](https://gondal.de), which is in operation even today.

Spearheaded by Argail, the Gladiators 2 community went on to rename the project "Arenakampf" and also gave it a new design: [Redesign and rename into arenakampf.de](https://web.archive.org/web/20150927070655/http://arenakampf.de/). The game managed to stay active until 2018, when it ultimately shut down.

Arena Wars is an attempt to capture the spirit of the game and its past, and make it come alive again with a modern codebase. And to - maybe - even reconnect with old players. If you are an old player and have been waiting for a "new gladi", feel free to hop in to the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/Tzt4qbnUJC) and say hi.
